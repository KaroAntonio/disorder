To send or not to send
I make up for my opinions with bad posture, 
Let my little lies work so that we might find some peace of mind- or something like it. 
Expression, what's need from me- from you.
Someone with painted palms 
feels down the street
Pulling sheets down off clothes linesyx. 
Someone with painted palms- kissed my forehead, 
And I fell down, ripped down silk sheets. 
Making good choices, 
because I know you'll hurt me and I don't need to feel your fingers in my brain to know that it's going to bring another full fledged rain 
We are conventions- some 'type' of expressions. 
Carving up versions of ourselves to offer in the deeper districts. Carving up ourselves for professionalism- illiterate at the body language- don't mind my bad posture/ crossed arms. I promise I'm inviting. 
I have some that are mine 
I have some that are yours 
I have some that are mine 
I have some that are yours 
Putting stress on the 
Buttons 
Wait to press play, to download- pirating happiness 
Torrenting emotions, virtual romance. 
Tell me again that the beginning needs to be capitalized- that there really is a 'u' in colour. 
How can I fuck with love when I've got a heart shaped hole behind my ribs?
suppose you could edit it out. 			still feels the same.
